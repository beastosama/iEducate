            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in Nepal was long based on home-schooling and gurukulas.
                This was similar to the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn either in
                their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country, the
                general public had no access to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School,
                established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Primary education in Nepal called Basic Education consists of grades one
                through eight. Secondary levels are grades nine to twelve. Pre-primary education is available in some
                areas, and students usually begin grade one at age five. A Basic Level Examination (BLE), previously
                known as District Level Examination (DLE), is given on grade eight while a national Secondary Education
                Exam (SEE), previously known as School Leaving Certificate (SLC), is examination is conducted at the end
                of grade 10, while completing the Grade 12 examination leads to the School Leaver's Certificate. The
                National Examinations Board (NEB) supervises all BLE, SEE and 12th grade exams.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                University education leads successfully to the degrees of bachelor, master and doctor (PhD). Depending
                upon the educational stream and degree subject, a bachelor's degree may require as much as three to five
                years of study, but two years is the typical duration. Some universities offer M.Phil. and post-graduate
                diplomas.</p>
